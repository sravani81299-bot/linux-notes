Expected Answer:

Security Group → Port 22 allowed

Correct key pair

Correct username (ec2-user, ubuntu)

Instance is running

Check NACL

Check route table (Internet Gateway attached)

Disk not full

Q2️⃣ How do you check CPU and memory usage on a Linux server?
Answer:

top
htop

Q3️⃣ A Linux server is running slow. How do you troubleshoot?
Answer:

Check CPU → top

Check memory → free -m

Check disk → df -h

Q4️⃣ Difference between kill and kill -9?
Answer:

kill → Graceful termination

kill -9 → Force kill (SIGKILL)

🔹 Round 2: AWS Core Services
