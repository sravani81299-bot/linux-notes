Linux Server Monitoring & Backup Project – Simple Explanation
1️⃣ Project Objective

Monitor server health automatically (CPU, memory, disk, processes).

Backup user data daily.

Secure the server using SSH and firewall.

Automate everything with cron (and optionally systemd).

2️⃣ Users & Permissions

root → full admin access, runs cron jobs, manages firewall, owns logs and scripts.

user1 → normal user for SSH login, limited access to system.

admins group → optional group for shared access if more users are added.

Principle: separation of privileges and least privilege access.

3️⃣ System Monitoring

Script: /project_data/system_monitor.sh

Collects system health information: CPU, memory, disk usage, top processes.

Output logged to /root/system_monitor.log.

Cron job runs every 30 minutes:

*/30 * * * * /project_data/system_monitor.sh >> /root/system_monitor.log 2>&1


This ensures server status is automatically recorded for analysis.

4️⃣ Automated Backup

Script: /project_data/backup.sh

Runs daily at 2 AM via cron:

0 2 * * * /project_data/backup.sh


Backs up /home directory to /backup as a compressed file:

/backup/home_backup_<DATE>.tar.gz


Keeps only the last 7 days of backups. Older backups are deleted.

Logs operations in /backup/backup.log.

Ensures data safety and retention without manual intervention.

5️⃣ Server Security

SSH Hardening: disable root login for SSH:

PermitRootLogin no


Firewall (UFW): restricts access to only necessary ports:

sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
sudo ufw enable


Prevents unauthorized access to the server.

6️⃣ Automation Tools

Cron jobs → schedule monitoring every 30 mins and backups daily.

systemd service → optional automation tool for monitoring script (disabled in your final setup).

Shows understanding of both classic and modern Linux task automation.

7️⃣ Logs & Verification

Monitoring logs: /root/system_monitor.log

Backup logs: /backup/backup.log

Firewall status: sudo ufw status verbose

Cron jobs check: sudo crontab -l or grep CRON /var/log/syslog

Allows you to verify everything is running as expected.

8️⃣ What You Learned / Skills Demonstrated

Linux user/group management and permissions.

Bash scripting for automation.

Cron scheduling for repetitive tasks.

System monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, processes).

Automated backups with retention.

Server security using firewall (UFW) and SSH hardening.

Optional systemd service creation.

Shows practical DevOps & Linux administration skills.

9️⃣ How to Explain in Interviews

“This project automates server monitoring and backups.
It uses cron to run a monitoring script every 30 minutes and a backup script daily at 2 AM.
The /home directory is backed up as a compressed .tar.gz archive with a 7-day retention policy.
The server is secured with UFW firewall rules and SSH hardening.
I used one SSH user for login and root for administrative tasks, demonstrating Linux permission management.
The project shows both automation and security best practices.”
