1️⃣ Root Account (root user)

🔹 What it is:
The root account is the superuser in Linux.

🔹 Who it is:

Username: root

UID: 0

Has unlimited permissions

🔹 What root can do:

Delete system files

Create / delete users

Install software

Start / stop services

Mount disks

Change permissions of any file

👉 Root = Administrator of Linux

Example:

whoami
# root


⚠️ Because root is so powerful, it’s used carefully.

2️⃣ / → Root Directory (VERY IMPORTANT)

This is NOT the root user.

🔹 / is the top-most directory in Linux
🔹 Everything in Linux starts from /

Think of / as the base of the entire file system tree 🌳

Example:

/
├── bin
├── etc
├── home
├── root
├── usr
├── var


📌 Key point:

/ is the starting point of the filesystem, not a user.

3️⃣ /root → Root User’s Home Directory

This is where confusion usually happens 😄

🔹 /root is the home directory of the root user
🔹 Just like:

/home/sravani → your home directory

/root → root user’s home directory

Check:

echo $HOME
# /root   (when logged in as root)


🔹 Only root can access /root (by default)

4️⃣ Comparison Table (Crystal Clear 🧠)
Term	Meaning
root account	Superuser (UID 0)
/	Root directory (top of filesystem)
/root	Home directory of root user
5️⃣ Simple Analogy 🏠

Imagine a building:

🧑 Root account → Building owner (can enter any room)

🏢 / → The building itself

🛏 /root → Owner’s private room

🛏 /home/user → Other people’s rooms

6️⃣ Common Interview Trap Question ❗

❓ Is / and /root the same?
👉 NO

✔ / = filesystem base
✔ /root = root user’s home directory
