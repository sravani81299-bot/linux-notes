“OS is a collection of many files & packages”
Linux does not have a single OS package file. The operating system is composed of multiple components such as the kernel, libraries, system utilities, configuration files, and services stored as files on disk.


linux booting process is a sequence of events that occure from the moment you power on the system until the operating system is fully loaded and ready for use....
step1:
Power ON (Switch On)
You press the power button
Electricity reaches the system
CPU wakes up and looks for instructions
step2:
bios is firmware
BIOS is a small program stored on the motherboard
It does:
Checks hardware (RAM, keyboard, disk) → POST
Finds the bootable disk (HDD/SSD)
step3:
A bootloader is a program that loads the operating system into memory when the computer starts.
The bootloader is stored in the MBR for BIOS systems
The bootloader loads only the kernel because the kernel is required to control hardware and load other OS components dynamically. Loading the entire OS would be inefficient and unnecessary.
Bootloader (GRUB)
BIOS/UEFI loads the bootloader
In Linux, this is usually GRUB
GRUB:
Shows OS options (if multiple)
Loads the Linux kernel into memory
step4:
Kernel is the core of Linux
Linux Kernel----after kernel is loaded into the memory
it Controls CPU, memory, devices
Detects hardware
Mounts the root filesystem
step5:
systemd is the init system started by the kernel. It initializes the system by starting required services and then provides either a command-line login for servers or a graphical login for desktop systems.
