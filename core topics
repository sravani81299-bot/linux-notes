1. Process Management

Definition:
Process management is the function of the Linux kernel that creates, schedules, executes, and terminates processes.

Explanation:

A process is a running program

Kernel decides which process gets CPU and for how long

Handles multitasking and process priority

Example:
Running top shows all active processes.

2. Memory Management

Definition:
Memory management controls how RAM is allocated and released for running processes.

Explanation:

Allocates memory when a program starts

Frees memory when a program ends

Uses virtual memory & swap to handle low RAM situations

Example:
Linux uses swap space when RAM is full.

3. File System Management

Definition:
File system management organizes and manages how data is stored, accessed, and protected on disks.

Explanation:

Manages files, directories, and permissions

Supports file systems like ext4, xfs

Controls read/write operations

Example:
/home, /etc, /var are part of Linux file system hierarchy.

4. Device Control

Definition:
Device control allows the kernel to communicate with hardware devices using drivers.

Explanation:

Handles devices like keyboard, disk, network card

Uses device drivers for hardware interaction

In Linux, devices are treated as files

Example:
Hard disk appears as /dev/sda.

What is Shell?

Definition (Interview Answer):
👉 A shell is a command-line interpreter that acts as an interface between the user and the Linux kernel.

Simple Explanation

User types a command

Shell understands the command

Shell sends the request to the kernel

Kernel executes it and returns output

Real-World Example

Think of the shell as a translator 🗣️:

User speaks commands

Kernel understands system calls

Shell converts commands into kernel-understandable actions

Common Shells in Linux
Shell	Description
bash	Most common (default)
sh	Original shell
zsh	Advanced features
ksh	Korn shell
fish	User-friendly shell
Shell vs Terminal (Interview Trap)
Shell	Terminal
Program that executes commands	Application to type commands
Interprets commands	Displays input/output
Example: bash	Example: GNOME Terminal
Shell Script

👉 A shell script is a file containing multiple Linux commands executed automatically.

Example:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello Linux"

1-Line Interview Answer
