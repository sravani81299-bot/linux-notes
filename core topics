1. Process Management

Definition:
Process management is the function of the Linux kernel that creates, schedules, executes, and terminates processes.

Explanation:

A process is a running program

Kernel decides which process gets CPU and for how long

Handles multitasking and process priority

Example:
Running top shows all active processes.

2. Memory Management

Definition:
Memory management controls how RAM is allocated and released for running processes.

Explanation:

Allocates memory when a program starts

Frees memory when a program ends

Uses virtual memory & swap to handle low RAM situations

Example:
Linux uses swap space when RAM is full.

3. File System Management

Definition:
File system management organizes and manages how data is stored, accessed, and protected on disks.

Explanation:

Manages files, directories, and permissions

Supports file systems like ext4, xfs

Controls read/write operations

Example:
/home, /etc, /var are part of Linux file system hierarchy.

4. Device Control

Definition:
Device control allows the kernel to communicate with hardware devices using drivers.

Explanation:

Handles devices like keyboard, disk, network card

Uses device drivers for hardware interaction

In Linux, devices are treated as files

Example:
Hard disk appears as /dev/sda.

What is Shell?

Definition (Interview Answer):
👉 A shell is a command-line interpreter that acts as an interface between the user and the Linux kernel.

Simple Explanation

User types a command

Shell understands the command

Shell sends the request to the kernel

Kernel executes it and returns output

Simple Diagram

Shell (bash)

Real-World Example

Think of the shell as a translator 🗣️:

User speaks commands

Kernel understands system calls

Shell converts commands into kernel-understandable actions

Common Shells in Linux
Shell	Description
bash	Most common (default)
sh	Original shell
zsh	Advanced features
ksh	Korn shell
fish	User-friendly shell
Shell vs Terminal (Interview Trap)
Shell	Terminal
Program that executes commands	Application to type commands
Interprets commands	Displays input/output
Example: bash	Example: GNOME Terminal
Shell Script

👉 A shell script is a file containing multiple Linux commands executed automatically.

Example:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello Linux"

1-Line Interview Answer

Shell is a command-line interface that allows users to communicate with the Linux kernel by executing commands.

Common Shell Commands

ls

cd

pwd

echo

history

What is a Link in Linux?

A link is a reference (shortcut) to a file.

There are two types:

Hard link

Soft link (Symbolic link)

🔹 Hard Link
Definition:

👉 A hard link is another name for the same file (same inode).

Explanation:

Points directly to the inode

Original file and hard link are equal

Deleting one does not delete data

Example:
ln file1 file1_hard

Key Points:

Shares same inode number

Data remains until all hard links are deleted

Cannot link directories

Cannot cross file systems

🔹 Soft Link (Symbolic Link)
Definition:

👉 A soft link is a shortcut that points to the file name/path.

Explanation:

Has a different inode

Points to the original file path

If original file is deleted → link breaks

Example:
ln -s file1 file1_soft

Key Points:

Different inode number

Can link directories

Can cross file systems

Breaks if original file is removed

🔥 Hard Link vs Soft Link (Interview Table)
Feature	Hard Link	Soft Link
Inode	Same	Different
File type	Regular file	Shortcut
If original deleted	Works	Broken
Cross filesystem	❌ No	✅ Yes
Link directories	❌ No	✅ Yes
Size	Same as file	Very small
🔹 Real-World Example
Hard Link:

Think of two names for the same person 👤
Deleting one name doesn’t remove the person.

Soft Link:

Think of a Google Maps shortcut 📍
If the address changes, shortcut fails.

🔹 Commands to Check
ls -li


👉 Shows inode numbers (same inode = hard link)

ls -l


👉 Shows soft link (l) and arrow (->)

⭐ One-Line Interview Answer

A hard link points directly to the inode and remains valid even if the original file is deleted, while a soft link points to the file path and breaks if the original file is removed.


Definition (Interview Answer):
👉 umask (User Mask) defines the default permission that is REMOVED when a new file or directory is created.

Simple Explanation

Linux has default maximum permissions

Files → 666 (rw-rw-rw-)

Directories → 777 (rwxrwxrwx)

umask subtracts permissions from these defaults

Formula (VERY IMPORTANT)
Final Permission = Default Permission – umask

Default umask Values
User Type	umask
Normal user	002
Root	022
Example 1️⃣ (Most Common Interview One)
umask = 022
File:
666 - 022 = 644 → rw-r--r--

Directory:
777 - 022 = 755 → rwxr-xr-x

Do files and directories use umask by default?

👉 YES.
Whenever you create a new file or directory, Linux automatically applies the umask to decide its default permissions.

Think of umask like a safety filter 🛡️
Even if full access is possible, umask removes dangerous permissions by default.
