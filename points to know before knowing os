Kernel — The Boss of the System 🧠
What is the Kernel?

The kernel is the heart of Linux.
It directly talks to hardware and controls everything.

👉 Without the kernel, Linux cannot exist.

What the kernel does:

Talks to CPU, RAM, disk, network, devices

Manages processes (which program runs when)

Manages memory (who gets RAM)

Manages filesystems

Handles hardware drivers

Controls system calls (how programs request resources)

Simple example:

When you run:

ls


ls → asks the kernel

Kernel → reads disk

Kernel → returns file list

📍 Kernel file location:

/boot/vmlinuz-*


💡 Kernel runs in kernel space (very powerful, very protected)

2️⃣ Libraries — Helpers for Programs 📚
What are Libraries?

Libraries are pre-written code that programs reuse instead of writing everything again.

👉 Programs do NOT talk to the kernel directly.
They use libraries.

Why libraries exist:

Avoid rewriting common code

Make programs smaller

Provide standard behavior

Common Linux library:

glibc (GNU C Library)

Example:

A program wants to:

Open a file

Print text

Use network

Instead of writing kernel code, it calls:

printf()
open()
read()


These functions live in libraries, which then talk to the kernel.

📍 Library locations:

/lib
/lib64
/usr/lib
/usr/lib64


💡 Libraries run in user space

3️⃣ System Utilities — Tools for Users & Admins 🛠️
What are System Utilities?

These are basic command-line tools used to manage the system.

👉 They are just programs, but very important ones.

Examples:

File tools: ls, cp, mv, rm

Process tools: ps, top, kill

Disk tools: df, mount, umount

Network tools: ip, ping, ss

User tools: useradd, passwd

📍 Utility locations:

/bin
/sbin
/usr/bin
/usr/sbin

Flow:

User → Utility → Library → Kernel → Hardware

💡 Utilities are the interface between humans and Linux internals.

4️⃣ Configuration Files — Settings of the System ⚙️
What are Configuration Files?

These are text files that control how programs and services behave.

👉 Linux does NOT use registry like Windows
👉 Everything is file-based

Key properties:

Plain text

Editable

Read at startup or reload time

Examples:
File	Purpose
/etc/passwd	User accounts
/etc/shadow	Passwords
/etc/ssh/sshd_config	SSH settings
/etc/fstab	Disk mount rules
/etc/hosts	Hostname resolution

📍 Main location:

/etc

Example:
Port 22
PermitRootLogin no


This config controls SSH behavior.

💡 Change config → restart service → new behavior

5️⃣ Services — Background Workers 🔄
What are Services?

Services are programs that run in the background to provide functionality.

👉 They start at boot or on demand
👉 Managed by systemd

Examples:

sshd → remote login

nginx → web server

cron → scheduled jobs

docker → container engine

kubelet → Kubernetes node agent

Service actions:
systemctl start sshd
systemctl stop nginx
systemctl restart docker
systemctl status cron


📍 Service definitions:

/usr/lib/systemd/system/
/etc/systemd/system/

Service flow:

Service → Libraries → Kernel → Hardware

💡 Services keep the system alive and useful

🔗 How Everything Connects (Very Important)
Example: SSH Login

1️⃣ Service: sshd is running
2️⃣ Config file: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
3️⃣ Utility: ssh command
4️⃣ Library: glibc handles system calls
5️⃣ Kernel: manages process, network, memory
6️⃣ Hardware: CPU, RAM, NIC

📌 All layers work together.

🧠 One-Line Summary (Interview Gold)
Component	Role
Kernel	Controls hardware & resources
Libraries	Bridge between apps and kernel
System Utilities	User/admin tools
Configuration Files	System settings
Services	Background system processes
