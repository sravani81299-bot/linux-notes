Mock Interview: Linux Monitoring & Backup Automation Project
Q1️⃣ Can you explain your project in simple terms?

Interviewer:
Tell me about the Linux project you worked on.

Your Answer (Model):

I implemented a Linux server monitoring and backup automation system on an Ubuntu VM.
The system monitors CPU, memory, disk usage, and top processes using a Bash script, logs the output, and runs automatically via cron and systemd.
I also automated daily backups with a retention policy and secured the server using SSH hardening and UFW firewall.

Q2️⃣ Why did you choose Bash scripting for monitoring?

Interviewer:
Why Bash instead of Python or another language?

Your Answer:

Bash is lightweight, natively available on Linux, and ideal for system-level tasks.
Since the monitoring relies on standard Linux commands like uptime, free, df, and ps, Bash allows direct execution without additional dependencies.

Q3️⃣ How does your monitoring system work?

Interviewer:
Walk me through how monitoring happens step by step.

Your Answer:

The monitoring script collects system metrics like CPU load, memory usage, disk usage, and running processes.
The script writes this output to /root/system_monitor.log.
Cron runs the script every 30 minutes, and systemd ensures the script can be executed reliably when required.

Q4️⃣ Why did you use both cron and systemd?

Interviewer:
Isn’t cron enough? Why systemd also?

Your Answer:

Cron is ideal for time-based scheduling, but systemd provides better service control, logging, and dependency handling.
I used systemd to demonstrate service management and to ensure the monitoring script can be executed in a controlled, managed way aligned with system boot targets.

Q5️⃣ Why is your systemd service Type=oneshot?

Interviewer:
Why not a long-running service?

Your Answer:

The monitoring script runs, collects data, and exits—it doesn’t need to stay running.
Type=oneshot is ideal for short-lived tasks and avoids unnecessary resource usage.

Q6️⃣ How do you verify that cron jobs are running correctly?

Interviewer:
How do you confirm cron is actually executing?

Your Answer:

I verify cron execution by checking /var/log/syslog for CRON entries, reviewing timestamps in log files, and confirming updated output in /root/system_monitor.log and /backup/backup.log.

Q7️⃣ Explain your backup strategy.

Interviewer:
How does your backup system work?

Your Answer:

A Bash script creates a compressed tar archive of the /home directory daily at 2 AM.
Each backup is timestamped, logged, and stored in /backup.
A retention policy deletes backups older than 7 days to prevent disk exhaustion.

Q8️⃣ Why did you implement a retention policy?

Interviewer:
What problem does retention solve?

Your Answer:

Without retention, backups would grow indefinitely and fill disk space.
The retention policy ensures only recent backups are kept, balancing data safety and storage efficiency.

Q9️⃣ How do you confirm backups are valid?

Interviewer:
How do you know backups are usable?

Your Answer:

I verify backup creation by checking archive files and logs.
I can also test integrity by listing archive contents using tar -tzf without extracting the full backup.

🔟 How did you secure the server?

Interviewer:
What security measures did you implement?

Your Answer:

I disabled SSH root login to reduce brute-force risk and enforced user-based access.
I enabled UFW firewall and allowed only SSH traffic, following the principle of least privilege.

Q1️⃣1️⃣ What would happen if the disk becomes full?

Interviewer:
How does your system handle disk space issues?

Your Answer:

Disk usage is continuously monitored and logged.
Backup retention prevents uncontrolled growth, and monitoring logs help identify disk pressure early.
This setup can easily be extended to alerting if disk usage crosses thresholds.

Q1️⃣2️⃣ How would you improve this project for production?

Interviewer:
What would you add next?

Your Answer:

I would add log rotation using logrotate, alerting via email or Slack for threshold breaches, encryption for backups, offsite storage like S3, and configuration management using Ansible.

Q1️⃣3️⃣ What Linux concepts does this project demonstrate?

Interviewer:
What skills does this project prove?

Your Answer:

It demonstrates Bash scripting, cron scheduling, systemd services, logging, backup strategies, security hardening, Linux file system management, and operational troubleshooting.

Q1️⃣4️⃣ How is this relevant to a DevOps or Cloud role?

Interviewer:
Why should we care about this project?

Your Answer:

This project reflects real-world DevOps responsibilities—monitoring system health, automating backups, securing servers, and ensuring reliability using native Linux tools.

Q1️⃣5️⃣ Final Trick Question 😏

Interviewer:
What happens if cron stops running?

Your Answer:

Monitoring logs would stop updating.
I’d troubleshoot by checking the cron service status, reviewing system logs, validating script permissions, and confirming absolute paths in the cron configuration.
