linux file system

/ --> If you look at the file system graphically, you’ll see all other directories branching from this root directory.
Every single file and directory start from the root directory.
The only root user has the right to write under this directory.
/root is the root user’s home directory, which is not the same as /
Only the root user has permission to modify contents inside this directory. Regular users cannot make changes here. 
For example, if you attempt to create a file in / as a non-root user, you’ll encounter a "Permission Denied" error.

/bin : 
The /bin directory contains essential commands and binaries needed by all users, including cp, ls, ssh, and kill. These commands are universally available across user types.
Contains binary executables.
Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.
Commands used by all the users of the system are located here e.g. ps, ls, ping, grep, cp 

/boot :
This directory stores all files required for booting the system. It includes the GRUB bootloader configuration and essential kernel files that are loaded during startup. 
Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot
Example: initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic, vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic

 /dev :
Device files in Linux are stored in the /dev directory. These are special files that act as interfaces between hardware and software. Device files are of two types: 
block devices (e.g., hard drives) and character devices (e.g., microphones and speakers). Examples include /dev/sda1 for disk partitions.
These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
Example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0

/home :
Every non-root user has a personal directory inside /home. For example, if your username is anshu, your personal directory would be /home/anshu. 
Each user can create, delete, or modify files only in their own home directory and cannot access others’ home directories.
Home directories for all users to store their personal files, containing saved files, personal settings, etc..
Example: /home/kishlay, /home/kv

/media:
Devices like USBs, CDs, and pen drives are mounted under /media. For example, when a CD-ROM is inserted (appeared in FHS-2.3), its details will appear here.
Temporary mount directory for removable devices.
Examples: /media/cdrom for CD-ROM; /media/floppy for floppy drives; /media/cdrecorder for CD writer
Used by the system to automatically mount removable media.
Examples
USB drives
External HDD
CD/DVD

/tmp : 
Programs create temporary files during execution, and these are stored in /tmp. These files are deleted automatically after the program finishes or when the system is restarted.
Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.
Files under this directory are deleted when the system is rebooted.

/sbin:
the /sbin directory stands for system binaries. It contains essential executable programs that are primarily used for system administration, 
maintenance, and booting, and are generally intended for the root user.
/sbin holds commands necessary for booting the system, restoring, recovering, and/or repairing the system, often before the /usr filesystem is mounted.

/lib/ : Necessary libraries for booting the system and running basic commands in the root filesystem (for binaries in /bin or /sbin).
/lib contains shared libraries needed by:
/bin
/sbin
Kernel modules
Think of libraries as support files that binaries depend on.
Why it’s critical
If /lib is missing:
Commands won’t run
Kernel won’t load drivers
System won’t boot ❌
📌 Analogy:
/lib is like engine oil — not visible, but without it nothing works

/srv = “service data”
It is a directory meant to store data that is served by system services like:
Web servers (Apache, Nginx)
FTP servers
File-sharing services
Git repositories
Application services
📌 Think of /srv as:
“This data is meant to be accessed by users or clients over the network.”

/proc is a virtual (pseudo) filesystem created by the kernel.
Created dynamically at system boot
Destroyed automatically at system shutdown
Not stored on disk (exists only in RAM)
If you reboot → /proc is recreated fresh.
/proc = kernel data presented as text
Process Information in /proc
The /proc filesystem contains real-time information about currently running processes.
Each running process is represented by a directory
The directory name equals the Process ID (PID)
/proc/1
Listing /proc contents
ls -l /proc
This command lists:
Files
Directories
Permissions
Ownership
Size (mostly 0 because files are virtual)
Last modification time
📌 This information helps in:
Monitoring system state
Debugging performance issues
Troubleshooting running processes

/opt
is used to install optional or third-party applications separately from core OS files, keeping the system clean and manageable.

/mnt 
is a standard Linux directory used for temporarily mounting filesystems manually, mainly by system administrators.

/lib
It contains essential shared libraries and kernel modules needed for the system to work, especially during boot.
What is a Library?
A library is a collection of pre-written code that programs use instead of writing everything from scratch.
Example:
If many programs need to print text, they all use the same library function.
Why /lib is Important?
Needed for system boot
Needed for basic system commands
Used by shell and init/systemd
Without /lib, Linux cannot start properly
Think of /lib as:
“Engine parts of the Linux system”

/usr:
contains system-wide user commands, admin tools, libraries, shared data, and development files required for normal system operation.
Key contents of /usr
/usr/bin: Contains user commands (binaries) not essential for booting (e.g., zip, curl).
/usr/sbin: Contains non-essential system administration binaries, requiring root privileges.
/usr/lib: Libraries needed by programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
/usr/share: Architecture-independent data, like documentation, icons, and fonts.
/usr/include: Header files for compiling programs. 

/run - Stores volatile runtime data such as process IDs and system information.

/sys - A virtual file system used to interact with and manage hardware devices and kernel information.

/var = variable data
It stores files that change frequently while the system is running.
stores variable data such as logs, caches, mail, and runtime files that change during normal system operation.
Used for:
Debugging issues
Security audits
Troubleshooting services
