1️⃣ First, what problem does systemd solve?

After Linux kernel starts, the system needs to:

Start networking

Start SSH

Start Docker

Start cron jobs

Start login screen / terminal

Keep services running

Restart services if they crash

👉 Someone must manage all this

That “someone” is systemd.

2️⃣ What exactly is systemd?
Simple definition:

systemd is the first program started by the kernel, and it manages the entire system.

It starts services

It stops services

It monitors services

It restarts failed services

It handles boot order

📌 systemd = system manager

3️⃣ Where does systemd start in the boot process?

Boot flow (simplified):

Power ON
   ↓
BIOS / UEFI
   ↓
Bootloader (GRUB)
   ↓
Linux Kernel
   ↓
systemd   ← ⭐ HERE
   ↓
Login screen / terminal


👉 After the kernel is ready, it hands control to systemd.

4️⃣ What is systemd responsible for?

Think of systemd as a manager in an office 👔

systemd responsibilities:
Task	Example
Start services	ssh, docker, nginx
Stop services	shutdown/reboot
Restart services	restart nginx if it crashes
Dependency handling	start network before ssh
Parallel startup	start many services at once
Logging	using journalctl
5️⃣ What is a “service” in systemd?
Simple meaning:

A service is a program that runs in the background.

Examples:

sshd → allows SSH login

docker → runs containers

nginx → web server

kubelet → Kubernetes node agent

In systemd, services are defined using unit files.

6️⃣ What is a systemd unit?
Unit = configuration file

systemd manages different types of units:

Unit Type	Purpose
.service	   background services
.target	   group of services
.mount	   mount points
.socket	   socket-based activation
.timer	   scheduled jobs (like cron)

👉 Most important for now: .service and .target

7️⃣ systemd service file (simple example)

Example: SSH service

📍 Location:

/usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service


📄 Content (simplified):

[Unit]
Description=OpenSSH Server
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/sshd
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Explain line by line:
[Unit]

Description → human-readable name

After=network.target → start SSH after network

[Service]

ExecStart → command to start service

Restart=always → restart if it crashes

[Install]

WantedBy=multi-user.target → start at system boot

8️⃣ What is a target?
Target = group of services

Targets define system state.

Common targets:

Target	Meaning
multi-user.target	   Server mode (CLI)
graphical.target	   Desktop mode (GUI)
rescue.target	      Single-user rescue
shutdown.target	   System shutdown

👉 When systemd reaches a target, it starts all services linked to it.

9️⃣ How systemd starts services (dependency logic)

Example:

network.target
   ↓
sshd.service
   ↓
user login


systemd ensures:

Network is ready

Then SSH starts

Then users can log in

🚀 No guessing, no race conditions

🔟 systemctl – how we control systemd

systemctl = command to talk to systemd

Common commands:
systemctl status nginx
systemctl start nginx
systemctl stop nginx
systemctl restart nginx
systemctl enable nginx
systemctl disable nginx

Meaning:

start → start now

enable → start on boot

status → health check

1️⃣1️⃣ How systemd handles failures

If a service crashes:

systemd detects it

Restarts it automatically (if configured)

Logs the failure

Logs:

journalctl -u nginx


👉 This is very important for production & DevOps.

1️⃣2️⃣ systemd vs old init (why systemd is better)
Old init	                     systemd
Starts services one by one	   Parallel startup
No dependency handling	      Dependency aware
Weak logging	               Powerful logging
Slow boot	                  Fast boot

1️⃣3️⃣ Real-world DevOps example
When EC2 boots:

Kernel starts

systemd starts

systemd:

Starts networking

Starts Docker

Starts kubelet

Starts monitoring agent

Server becomes ready

👉 If Docker fails → systemd restarts it automatically

1️⃣4️⃣ One-line summary (remember this)

systemd is the boss process (PID 1) that starts, stops, monitors, and manages everything on a Linux system after the kernel boots.

After the kernel loads, systemd starts and activates the system’s default target (such as multi-user.target). The target itself does not run a process; 
instead, it groups and triggers multiple services and other units needed to bring the system to an operational state.
